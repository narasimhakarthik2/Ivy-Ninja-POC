During my final year project, I built an application using several APIs. After working on it for three months, I started to wonder how a product like Netflix could support millions of users streaming massive amounts of video simultaneously without interfering with other users by utilizing thousands of such APIs. To put it another way: How can an application be made scalable and available? Certainly, I could extend this question to online multiplayer games and social media applications. Unfortunately, scaling and optimization are challenging and expensive processes. These massively distributed systems would require novel system design strategies to be stochastically optimized. But these difficulties are precisely the reasons I think the Master's in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology will offer the best setting for me to continue my education.

Coding has always piqued my interest since I was in 10th grade. It still perplexes me that a single line of code can perform such complex operations in milliseconds. Thus, choosing a career as I got older was easy. During my undergraduate computer science and engineering studies, I was exposed to numerous math and computer-related disciplines, as well as challenging laboratory work in related fields. But with the Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) degree, I will be able to become a better thinker, programmer, and system architect, as well as gain a thorough understanding of current technologies and specialize in the application fields of backend development and system designing. I am interested in working with Professors Dr. Xian He Sun and Anthony Kougkas because their current work in scalable computing software laboratory on projects such as ChronoLog and Hermes complements my interest in the subject and their knowledge of architecture will allow me to expand the scope of my studies. My readiness and desire to further my education in the fields of computer science's backend development became clear to me.

Undoubtedly, the program will present numerous obstacles, but I am confident that my professional and academic experiences have prepared me to face them head-on. I studied numerous computer science topics, including machine learning, deep learning, game development, augmented reality application development with Unity, and the development of android and iOS applications. The artificial intelligence course taught by N.G. Andrew greatly influenced my project, "Conversational Chatbot Using Deep Learning." This course taught me how to increase the precision of Artificial Intelligence algorithms. My understanding of data structures and competitive coding gave me a solid foundation in backend development, from simple additions to complex algorithms like Bayesian Optimization and Dijkstra's Algorithm. I learned how to design machines that analyze enormous quantities of real-time data and how mathematical reasoning gives insights through modeling. In my third year, I took part in the Honeywell Hackathon and presented a human anatomy idea using augmented reality and leap motion technology. Modernizing the medical education system was the initiative's main goal. The solution proposed by my group ended up ranking in the top ten ideas presented that day. Aside from that, I participated in several hackathons at the undergraduate level. In addition, I had the pleasure of pursuing these interests during my second year of engineering while interning as an Android developer for "Lok Kalyan Samiti," an NGO. My work experience here has provided me with in-depth knowledge of Android application development. In a year, the application "Volunteer INDIA" on the Google Play Store received over 2000 downloads from all around India. Later in my senior year, I was given the opportunity to work as an iOS application developer intern at Evobi Automations Pvt. Ltd. (BIBOX). I mainly focused on integrating the SIRI speech-to-text recognition feature and the TensorFlow lite object detection model.

To better prepare for the demands of the MSCS program, I took online courses on system designs and architecture from Coding Ninjas, which is taught by Stanford alumnus Ankush Singla and covers various topics like introduction to Monolithic & Distributed Systems, architectural patterns, such as centralized and distributed. These online courses helped me comprehend crucial architecture paradigms, such as the CAP theorem, scaling techniques, and database optimizations, which will enable me to test edge cases in projects for my MSCS course. Additionally, I was able to optimize an algorithm for faster runtimes thanks to Stanford University MOOCs I completed on Coursera, like Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms Specialization. The MSCS program course will be the culmination of this self-study endeavor and offer a strong theoretical understanding of the techniques and tools employed in backend development.

My job as a software development engineer at SAP Labs India has not only provided me with strong technical skills but also given me the discipline to constantly learn what I do not yet know. I learned how to design scalable distributed systems using efficient algorithms while working on multiple projects like Document-Compliance-Gateway, Receipt-Orchestrator, and E-Bunsho, which are SAP Concur products that deal with receipt and invoice compliance for different countries. The technical skills I have acquired, combined with the unwavering tenacity I have developed in this position, will enable me to face any challenge that may arise during the MSCS program.

Along with my academic work, I have enjoyed organizing teams to plan both technical and non-technical events. I was a part of the planning committee for the intercollegiate hackathon at our college, called "inGenius-2019." This experience enabled me to put the management and entrepreneurship skills I had learned in a theoretical course into practice. My love for the open- source community and application development sparked my interest in developer student clubs (DSC). Developer Student Clubs are a technical club for college students supported by Google Developers. I led a workshop on building Android applications for first-year students.

After I graduate, I want to put the knowledge I've gained into practice by developing ground- breaking software solutions and revolutionizing the ways in which people engage with software applications and machines. To accomplish this goal, I intend to pursue a career as a backend developer/software architect. My ultimate objective is to fully comprehend complex system design concepts like DNS, load balancing, caching, database sharding, and partitioning to achieve application scalability and learn how to improve their efficiency to develop better software systems. In the long term, I intend to become a chief software architect for a technology company.

My time spent at Illinois Institute of Technology gaining practical experience will serve as a bridge between my past and future while also allowing me to contribute to the software development community. Through independent study and professional experience, I have built a solid foundation in computer science. I sincerely hope the admissions committee will take cognizance of my will to excel in my academic and professional responsibilities and admit me to the university's Master of Science in Computer Science program. I pledge to approach the program with the utmost commitment and to seize the opportunity to benefit the institution and myself.
