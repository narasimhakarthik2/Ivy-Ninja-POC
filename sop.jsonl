I marveled at how skin taken from her thigh could develop new blood vessels and connect seamlessly to surrounding healthy tissue. Seeing this phenomenon, I posed my first research question: Is it possible to grow functional human tissue in a laboratory? Ten years later, as a research fellow at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I still pursue this question. My mother\u2019s procedure is a constant reminder of the humanity that drives the science. To me, tissue biofabrication research represents the tantalizing potential to usher in new approaches to medical procedures and expand our understanding of various disease states. Over time, my work has unearthed more intricate questions: How can we engineer more physiologically relevant tissue in vitro and better recapitulate native tissue architecture? Can these tissues be modulated for functional use in clinical and translational applications? These are ultimately the questions I seek to answer through Gotham University\u2019s (GU) PhD in Biomedical Engineering.\n\nDr. Victor Fries\u2019s lab is the ideal environment to explore my interests. His research has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of my current experimental approaches: because of his work on using decellularized extracellular matrix bioinks for bioprinting, I am motivated to incorporate more biologically inspired materials in my tissue constructs. I can also foresee how my interdisciplinary research experience can help extend his lab\u2019s research scope. Through a forthcoming collaboration between my NIH lab and Dr. Fries\u2019s and Dr. Edward Nygma\u2019s GU labs, I can bring my experience in developing vascularized lung tissue for high-throughput screening platforms to create lung-based disease models in his lab. I can thereby act as an institutional bridge, connecting government and academic research sectors for a mutual scientific goal. Drs. Selina Kyle and Lucius Fox\u2019s work is also extremely compelling \u2013 their respective cardiac tissue and tumor microenvironment models are wonderful avenues to use tissue engineering to understand complex diseases. For these reasons, I can visualize myself thriving at GU: I am confident I can fit in well with current projects, but I also believe I can contribute to expanding GU\u2019s scientific impact in tissue biofabrication.\n\nI have dedicated nearly six years developing the skills to excel as a graduate student. At Empire State University, I conducted four years of research, with each opportunity guiding me closer to tissue biofabrication. I first started in Dr. Talia al Ghul\u2019s lab, where I worked for a year using adeno-associated viruses and CRISPR/Cas9 to regenerate inner ear cells. I soon became fascinated with CRISPR/Cas9 and started in Dr. Dick Grayson\u2019s lab to explore my curiosity for disease modeling. I thus worked for two years generating a CRISPR/Cas9-based system to induce Alzheimer\u2019s-disease-related phenotypes in stem cell-derived neurons, after which I wondered how I could study pathogenesis on more complex in vitro systems. Consequently, I co-led a project in Dr. Barbara Gordon\u2019s lab developing tumor spheroids and analyzing volatile metabolites to understand the metabolic processes of ovarian cancer. Through undergraduate research, I learned crucial biological experimentation, but also exercised my passion for adaptive science communication \u2013 this allowed me to independently win competitive research grants and present six posters at local and national symposia.\n\nI was first introduced to tissue biofabrication research when I interned in Dr. Harleen Quinzel\u2019s 3D Tissue Bioprinting Lab and developed 3D omentum tissue to model ovarian cancer metastasis. Previous projects had fascinated me, but this one stirred something deep within, reminding me of initial scientific motivations and inspiring a new commitment to improve drug discovery platforms. This motivated me to accept a two-year position as a postbaccalaureate researcher in Dr. Quinzel\u2019s lab. In this role, I spearheaded three projects focused on the lung. The first two \u2013 2D and 3D lung epithelium models \u2013 were used to study viral infection and conduct COVID-19 drug screening, and the third was a collaborative project with GlaxoSmithKline to model and conduct drug screening for non-small cell lung carcinoma. My work has culminated in several poster presentations, a first-author publication (in preparation), and a second-author paper for a project developing 3D epithelial tissue on a microfluidics screening platform. Overall, my projects have trained me to identify a promising research question, execute experimental milestones, overcome obstacles with novel solutions, collaborate with diverse individuals, and finalize a project to publication.\n\nAt the NIH, I have worked diligently to understand the limitations of current in vitro platforms and the advantages afforded by 3D vascularized tissues for disease modeling. Now, I strive to cultivate more skillsets and tackle new scientific questions, both of which GU hosts unique opportunities for. I am excited by the prospect of taking classes alongside medical students and initiating new collaborations with physicians, which will provide the vital clinical perspective that I hope to gain for my career. Using my education, I aim to build a future as an educator, translational scientist, and biomedical engineering professor, leading my own tissue biofabrication lab to engineer new medical technologies. I believe that the past few years of dedicated work have prepared me extensively, and I look forward to taking on the intellectual challenges that GU has to offer.\n"}

This is a pious and cathartic experience after three years of trials and tribulations studying dentistry in India. However, this feeling did not last long for me, as I experienced a gradual shift in perspective, a result of my close interactions with patients. My eyes opened to problems outside patient\u2019s oral cavities, a dentist\u2019s most common area of interest. As India and particularly richer cities like Bangalore marched ahead in their growth stories, multiple antithetical experiences in basic healthcare started to deeply plague me. Some of the recurring themes among patients, as evidenced in literature as well, were \u2014 affordability of appropriate care, impaired access to healthcare facilities, and distrust in the quality of health systems in place. This has been consistent in the feedback I receive from patients too. More perniciously, an overall unsatisfactory experience with the dental hospital system eventually drove them away, never to return or follow up. However, the holistic picture across the country is much more stark.\n\nWorld Bank data suggests that about 62% of health expenditure in India is out of pocket by patients, the economic consequences of which could be dire for families from lower income brackets. In addition, existing solutions are only stopgap solutions. For example, private intervention in healthcare is good; but potential market failures and information asymmetry between patients and providers is largely disadvantageous to poorer patients, leading to disastrous consequences. While I noticed these issues long before the pandemic, the second wave of Covid-19, which devastated India, brought them to the forefront. I recall making frantic calls to secure hospital beds not just for my family, but strangers as well. This left a lasting feeling of helplessness that I needed to address. Issues of oxygen supply chain, inefficient resource management in delivering timely healthcare, and feeble policymaking further deteriorated the previously problematic healthcare system. This makes a basic premise for my deep interest in studying healthcare policy and administration.\n\nAt Gotham University, I plan to study the complex nature of healthcare administration. Studying at the Health Policy & Management Department will enable me to address the following issues based on aforementioned themes: How can we prevent entire families from declaring bankruptcy due to healthcare costs? How can hospitals continuously improve the overall health of a community? These questions spring to mind as I contemplate the future, and warrant a unique set of skills including but not limited to financial management of health services, developing evolved payment methods, and analytics in healthcare.\n\nI look forward to courses like Database Systems which will allow me to work with relational database systems, build on my elementary understanding of SQL, and help me work with data to make informed decisions. As an international student in a region with very little context of demographic and health trends, I believe Population Health Informatics will also provide an indispensable skill. Factoring appropriate epidemiological data into managerial decision-making \u2013 this is something I can take with me back home, given the apparent spatial health disparities. Furthermore, I believe it is of utmost importance for health systems to be cognizant of health trends in the communities they serve.\n\nThus, beyond the core curriculum, the Value-Driven Insurance Design Institute will allow me to explore pertinent concepts like alternative, value-based payment, which would be pivotal in reducing bankruptcies secondary to healthcare costs. The clinical nuances driving value-based insurance design play to my strengths as a clinician. Furthermore, I believe the Stark Leadership Center will provide valuable insight from industry practitioners, allowing me to build vital relationships, and helping me leverage cutting-edge research into the kind of decision-making that is crucial for fostering innovation. Lastly, I feel enthusiastic about participating in case competitions where I can hone high-level analytical skills while networking with peers from other schools.\n\nI fully realize the extent of the transition I intend to make, from a clinical field of study to that of management and administration. In my mandatory internship year as a dental student, I went beyond my confined role to assist in floor-level administration duties like stock/inventory management, maintaining outpatient registries, and addressing patient complaints. Part of my daily life as a dental student involved devising and revising treatment plans to fit patients\u2019 affordability, helping patients get through their anxiety, and managing their pain effectively.\n\nTo cement my understanding, I attempted to write on how the patient inflow at my hospital was affected due to the pandemic and the government policies put in place, taking into account stringency measures such as travel bans, school closures, etc. While the paper still needs work, I used the opportunity to teach myself basic Excel, data visualization, and entry-level data analysis. I then understood the value that regression analysis brings to the table.\n\nWith a newfound hunger for knowledge in the healthcare domain, I enrolled in a Graduate Certificate course at The Public Policy Institute of Bangalore, for which I received a scholarship for my keen interest in the field as a dental student. I gained a clearer understanding of the multifaceted nature of healthcare. The highlight of my time at PPIB was learning Bardach\u2019s Eightfold Path to policy analysis during a rigorous workshop, where I worked with a diverse team involving IT professionals and a nuclear medicine physicist. This provided me with a strong framework to approach problem-solving.\n\nI aim to retain a strong focus on the health system in the future, working as a healthcare management consultant to bridge gaps between providers and payers. Gotham University will be instrumental in making me a well-rounded healthcare manager, through its courses designed to cover a range of competencies like financing and strategic operations.\n\nIn an extremely heterogeneous society such as India with multidimensional divisions based on \u2014 caste, ethnicity, color, and region, a hierarchical structure backboned by the above is a lived experience to me. However, I am deeply privileged compared to most of my country in having the ability to apply to Gotham University. Beyond acknowledging this, it is my single-minded focus to work on healthcare systems to break these hierarchies.\n"}

During that time, I witnessed massive improvements to polysilicon production processes, and expected similar improvements for the Silicon Photovoltaic (PV) cells produced from this polysilicon. But, these improvements have not yet been realized. Raised in the scorching climate of Nigeria, and having seen electricity as a luxury, I am all too aware of the need to understand how we can more efficiently harness solar energy. Consequently, I have become passionate about the manufacturing processes for these more sustainable and widely available forms of energy. Today, my ultimate purpose is to significantly improve solar cells\u2019 low efficiency by studying multi-junction PV cells, as this method overcomes some of the drawbacks of the single junction cell by absorbing different wavelengths of sunlight. By pursuing further studies in the area of semiconductors and its application in the solar industry, I will be able to assist in paving the way for proper harnessing and accessibility of solar energy.\n\nWith a Master\u2019s in Electrical Engineering and a focus on semiconductors and devices from Gotham University, I will gain the necessary skills to achieve my goals. I am particularly excited about courses in the properties of semiconductors, integrated circuit fabrication, and solar energy conversion, which will give me a strong foundation in this field, and hopefully allow me to leverage my knowledge of semiconductor technology to reduce recombination losses and bulkiness in multi-junction PV cells. In the Advanced Micro and Nano Fabrication Laboratory, I will have the opportunity to test my fabrication skills through experiments like lattice matching of multijunction cells. Ultimately, these resources at Gotham will allow me to take part in further solar cell research, and thus pursue my goal of contributing to the development of more accessible energy sources.\n\nAt Gotham, I will meet a broad network of engineering students and faculty, and have access to research opportunities within the remarkable nanogotham facilities. I want to utilize my understanding of nanoparticles in cell fabrication to assist in experiments downshifting high-frequency light for multi-junction solar cell applications. I am excited to work with Dr. Lucius Fox, whose research in photovoltaics addresses issues in reflection and absorption losses, and has presented solutions like utilizing silicon nanoparticles to increase solar-cell efficiency. I hope to contribute to Dr. Fox\u2019s work by using my nanofabrication skills to investigate efficient and cost-effective applications of ultrathin crystalline silicon technology.\n\nIn my undergraduate years, I joined the Nanofabrication & Electron Transport Laboratory at Empire State University. As a researcher under Prof. Ra\u2019s al Ghul, I investigated physics and electrical transport properties in low-dimensional semiconductors, like MoS2. I acquired skills in microscopy and photolithography, including using optical microscopy to analyze and classify substrate for device applications. This experience gave me an understanding of semiconductor physics and its practical application in device fabrication, preparing me to tackle course concepts at Gotham, as well as collaborate with faculty members to further address issues in PV cells.\n\nI continued to learn about collaboration and adaptability by serving as the secretary of Empire State\u2019s Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and working as an electrical-engineering intern at Wayne, the world\u2019s largest polycrystalline semiconductor manufacturer. This internship showed me how research in semiconductors progresses into commercial application, further spiking my interest in the field. I also helped optimize their safety system by creating a program to size valves and electric actuators, and generated power-consumption savings through Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) installation. As secretary of IEEE, I collaborated with electrical engineering faculty to create programs that would enhance the recognition of the department and bring in more students. I also mentored freshmen in Electrical Engineering regarding future potential for research. Through these experiences, I learned how to be a leader, to collaborate, and to work with a group towards a common goal. I hope to contribute to the IEEE Gotham chapter, and larger engineering community, in much the same way.\n\nIn my final undergraduate semester, I took elective courses in device physics and solar-energy generation to gain a deeper understanding of photocells and current technologies in the solar industry. In \u201cAlternative Energy Sources and Conversion,\u201d my final project simulated a model for efficiency improvement using Lumogen Red 305 for downshifting and Sodium Yttrium Fluoride as our upconverting nanoparticle, and calculated about 15% increase in efficiency using luminescent concentrators. I believe these successes have prepared me to take part in future research opportunities and confidently communicate my work to peers and faculty members.\n\nAfter graduation, I aim to work with solar research organizations like Applied Materials or the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). I want to fully understand solar cells, particularly multi-junction cells, and how to improve their efficiency so as to create a better global ecosystem. I am fully ready to take on the challenges that the Gotham master\u2019s program provides, and will work hard to honor it if given the opportunity.\n"}

Surprisingly, the opportunity proved more rewarding than I could have imagined. The perseverance I cultivated as a ballerina proved essential as I immediately dove into the Psychology, Biology, and Philosophy curricula at Stark University, and I soon developed an interest in the neural regulation of metabolic development. After joining Dr. Jean Grey\u2019s research lab in my sophomore year (a position I have maintained ever since), I had the great fortune of studying the effects of obesogenic diets on conserved signaling pathways governing metabolic regulation in Drosophila melanogaster. Through this work, I have become singularly fascinated with the myriad factors that contribute to the growing obesity epidemic, and its developmental origins in particular.\n\nThe questions that underpin our work in the Grey Lab are compelling. How do critical or sensitive periods of neuroendocrine development contribute to long-term functioning in animals and humans at the behavioral and cellular levels? Interestingly, current research at Gotham University seeks answers to these very questions, and that is precisely why I apply as a PhD candidate to the interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Neuroscience.\n\nAt GU, I hope to continue elucidating hypothalamic metabolic circuits, and exploring how obesogenic diets affect long-term developmental outcomes in relation to the normal functioning of the satiety hormone leptin. I am quite interested in the work of Dr. Jonathan Crane, whose research on the development of hypothalamic circuits, and how they regulate feeding behavior, has been critical to my understanding of sensitive periods for the trophic actions of leptin in the brain. I believe my experience with quantitative immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR make me well qualified to contribute to such research. In fact, Dr. Crane\u2019s continuing work on the molecular signals connecting postnatal overnutrition to abnormal development of hypothalamic circuits represents questions similar to those that drew me to studying the neurobiological aspects of feeding and development. It also defines the kind of work I hope to accomplish as a doctoral candidate. While Dr. Crane\u2019s investigation into the necessity of LepRb for typical hypothalamic development is fascinating, I am interested in studying the role LepRb and its developmental actions might play in leptin resistance and obesity in adulthood.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Otto Octavius\u2019s research on the effects of high developmental sugar consumption on memory circuits is fascinating to me; it dovetails nicely with my experience using high-fructose corn syrup diets to mimic obesogenic conditions, while using both behavioral and molecular assays such as weight, food intake, and RNA sequencing to investigate physiological and neural changes. For these reasons, I believe I would be a great fit in either the Crane Lab or the Octavius Lab, given my experience researching metabolic development at both the behavioral and cellular level.\n\nHaving averaged 25 research hours per week during the last few academic years, and up to 50 during the summers, I believe I have acquired all the necessary tools to succeed as a graduate student at GU. I lead the developmental subdivision at the Grey Lab, a project investigating how the timing of a high-fructose diet during development affects cellular and behavioral outcomes in adult Drosophila as it relates to unpaired 1 \u2013 the Drosophila analog of leptin \u2013 and its downstream JAK/STAT signaling pathway. In investigating this evolutionarily conserved circuit, I created a new experimental protocol for carrying out developmental feeding experiments with Drosophila larvae, as well as performing behavioral assays related to feeding such as weight, two-choice feeding preference, and capillary feeding assays. Additionally, I have performed dissections and imaging with destabilized transgenic fly lines to quantify neuropeptide-f and STAT92E expression at both the cellular and terminal levels, hoping to elucidate the potential role of SOCS36E in receptor functioning. This work has lead to me identifying a unique obese phenotype related to early dysregulation of unpaired 1, of which I was slated to perform RNA sequencing prior to COVID-19 related disruptions.\n\nPursuing these research projects as an undergraduate has been a monumental task, I admit, so I am proud to have maintained a 4.0 GPA, all while achieving numerous successes in my second major, Philosophy. Having coauthored a paper in the American Journal of Bioethics, as well as winning the California Philosophical Association\u2019s undergraduate award and presenting at their annual conference, I am all the more confident in my readiness to succeed at GU.\n\nWhen my career in ballet drew to a close, I looked forward to fully devoting my time to the study of the human brain\u2019s infinitely curious adaptive processes. Now, I find myself in a similar situation, once again eager to devote myself to the study of the developing brain and how it governs metabolic regulation. The rigorous standards of The Grey Lab, along with Dr. Grey\u2019s strict belief in personal responsibility, have shown me that (like dance) true intellectual contributions are only possible through perseverance, determination, and a ruthless eye for weakness in both experimental design and execution. Balancing laboratory workloads with a full schedule of undergraduate classes has been a taxing endeavor, but this too has been essential to my growth as a researcher. Today, I look forward to the new intellectual challenges that Gotham University will provide, and I am sure that I will discover new passions, curiosities, and questions as I prepare for my hopeful career in academia, as a professor.\n"}

During that time, I witnessed massive improvements to polysilicon production processes, and expected similar improvements for the Silicon Photovoltaic (PV) cells produced from this polysilicon. But, these improvements have not yet been realized. Raised in the scorching climate of Nigeria, and having seen electricity as a luxury, I am all too aware of the need to understand how we can more efficiently harness solar energy. Consequently, I have become passionate about the manufacturing processes for these more sustainable and widely available forms of energy. Today, my ultimate purpose is to significantly improve solar cells\u2019 low efficiency by studying multi-junction PV cells, as this method overcomes some of the drawbacks of the single junction cell by absorbing different wavelengths of sunlight. By pursuing further studies in the area of semiconductors and its application in the solar industry, I will be able to assist in paving the way for proper harnessing and accessibility of solar energy.\n\nWith a Master\u2019s in Electrical Engineering and a focus on semiconductors and devices from Gotham University, I will gain the necessary skills to achieve my goals. I am particularly excited about courses in the properties of semiconductors, integrated circuit fabrication, and solar energy conversion, which will give me a strong foundation in this field, and hopefully allow me to leverage my knowledge of semiconductor technology to reduce recombination losses and bulkiness in multi-junction PV cells. In the Advanced Micro and Nano Fabrication Laboratory, I will have the opportunity to test my fabrication skills through experiments like lattice matching of multijunction cells. Ultimately, these resources at Gotham will allow me to take part in further solar cell research, and thus pursue my goal of contributing to the development of more accessible energy sources.\n\nAt Gotham, I will meet a broad network of engineering students and faculty, and have access to research opportunities within the remarkable nanogotham facilities. I want to utilize my understanding of nanoparticles in cell fabrication to assist in experiments downshifting high-frequency light for multi-junction solar cell applications. I am excited to work with Dr. Lucius Fox, whose research in photovoltaics addresses issues in reflection and absorption losses, and has presented solutions like utilizing silicon nanoparticles to increase solar-cell efficiency. I hope to contribute to Dr. Fox\u2019s work by using my nanofabrication skills to investigate efficient and cost-effective applications of ultrathin crystalline silicon technology.\n\nIn my undergraduate years, I joined the Nanofabrication & Electron Transport Laboratory at Empire State University. As a researcher under Prof. Ra\u2019s al Ghul, I investigated physics and electrical transport properties in low-dimensional semiconductors, like MoS2. I acquired skills in microscopy and photolithography, including using optical microscopy to analyze and classify substrate for device applications. This experience gave me an understanding of semiconductor physics and its practical application in device fabrication, preparing me to tackle course concepts at Gotham, as well as collaborate with faculty members to further address issues in PV cells.\n\nI continued to learn about collaboration and adaptability by serving as the secretary of Empire State\u2019s Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and working as an electrical-engineering intern at Wayne, the world\u2019s largest polycrystalline semiconductor manufacturer. This internship showed me how research in semiconductors progresses into commercial application, further spiking my interest in the field. I also helped optimize their safety system by creating a program to size valves and electric actuators, and generated power-consumption savings through Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) installation. As secretary of IEEE, I collaborated with electrical engineering faculty to create programs that would enhance the recognition of the department and bring in more students. I also mentored freshmen in Electrical Engineering regarding future potential for research. Through these experiences, I learned how to be a leader, to collaborate, and to work with a group towards a common goal. I hope to contribute to the IEEE Gotham chapter, and larger engineering community, in much the same way.\n\nIn my final undergraduate semester, I took elective courses in device physics and solar-energy generation to gain a deeper understanding of photocells and current technologies in the solar industry. In \u201cAlternative Energy Sources and Conversion,\u201d my final project simulated a model for efficiency improvement using Lumogen Red 305 for downshifting and Sodium Yttrium Fluoride as our upconverting nanoparticle, and calculated about 15% increase in efficiency using luminescent concentrators. I believe these successes have prepared me to take part in future research opportunities and confidently communicate my work to peers and faculty members.\n\nAfter graduation, I aim to work with solar research organizations like Applied Materials or the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). I want to fully understand solar cells, particularly multi-junction cells, and how to improve their efficiency so as to create a better global ecosystem. I am fully ready to take on the challenges that the Gotham master\u2019s program provides, and will work hard to honor it if given the opportunity.\n"}

After working on it for three months, I started to wonder how a product like Netflix could support millions of users streaming massive amounts of video simultaneously without interfering with other users by utilizing thousands of such APIs. To put it another way: How can an application be made scalable and available? Certainly, I could extend this question to online multiplayer games and social media applications. Unfortunately, scaling and optimization are challenging and expensive processes. These massively distributed systems would require novel system design strategies to be stochastically optimized. But these difficulties are precisely the reasons I think the Master's in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology will offer the best setting for me to continue my education.\n\nCoding has always piqued my interest since I was in 10th grade. It still perplexes me that a single line of code can perform such complex operations in milliseconds. Thus, choosing a career as I got older was easy. During my undergraduate computer science and engineering studies, I was exposed to numerous math and computer-related disciplines, as well as challenging laboratory work in related fields. But with the Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) degree, I will be able to become a better thinker, programmer, and system architect, as well as gain a thorough understanding of current technologies and specialize in the application fields of backend development and system designing. I am interested in working with Professors Dr. Xian He Sun and Anthony Kougkas because their current work in scalable computing software laboratory on projects such as ChronoLog and Hermes complements my interest in the subject and their knowledge of architecture will allow me to expand the scope of my studies. My readiness and desire to further my education in the fields of computer science's backend development became clear to me.\n\nUndoubtedly, the program will present numerous obstacles, but I am confident that my professional and academic experiences have prepared me to face them head-on. I studied numerous computer science topics, including machine learning, deep learning, game development, augmented reality application development with Unity, and the development of android and iOS applications. The artificial intelligence course taught by N.G. Andrew greatly influenced my project, \"Conversational Chatbot Using Deep Learning.\" This course taught me how to increase the precision of Artificial Intelligence algorithms. My understanding of data structures and competitive coding gave me a solid foundation in backend development, from simple additions to complex algorithms like Bayesian Optimization and Dijkstra's Algorithm. I learned how to design machines that analyze enormous quantities of real-time data and how mathematical reasoning gives insights through modeling. In my third year, I took part in the Honeywell Hackathon and presented a human anatomy idea using augmented reality and leap motion technology. Modernizing the medical education system was the initiative's main goal. The solution proposed by my group ended up ranking in the top ten ideas presented that day. Aside from that, I participated in several hackathons at the undergraduate level. In addition, I had the pleasure of pursuing these interests during my second year of engineering while interning as an Android developer for \"Lok Kalyan Samiti,\" an NGO. My work experience here has provided me with in-depth knowledge of Android application development. In a year, the application \"Volunteer INDIA\" on the Google Play Store received over 2000 downloads from all around India. Later in my senior year, I was given the opportunity to work as an iOS application developer intern at Evobi Automations Pvt. Ltd. (BIBOX). I mainly focused on integrating the SIRI speech-to-text recognition feature and the TensorFlow lite object detection model.\n\nTo better prepare for the demands of the MSCS program, I took online courses on system designs and architecture from Coding Ninjas, which is taught by Stanford alumnus Ankush Singla and covers various topics like introduction to Monolithic & Distributed Systems, architectural patterns, such as centralized and distributed. These online courses helped me comprehend crucial architecture paradigms, such as the CAP theorem, scaling techniques, and database optimizations, which will enable me to test edge cases in projects for my MSCS course. Additionally, I was able to optimize an algorithm for faster runtimes thanks to Stanford University MOOCs I completed on Coursera, like Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms Specialization. The MSCS program course will be the culmination of this self-study endeavor and offer a strong theoretical understanding of the techniques and tools employed in backend development.\n\nMy job as a software development engineer at SAP Labs India has not only provided me with strong technical skills but also given me the discipline to constantly learn what I do not yet know. I learned how to design scalable distributed systems using efficient algorithms while working on multiple projects like Document-Compliance-Gateway, Receipt-Orchestrator, and E-Bunsho, which are SAP Concur products that deal with receipt and invoice compliance for different countries. The technical skills I have acquired, combined with the unwavering tenacity I have developed in this position, will enable me to face any challenge that may arise during the MSCS program.\n\nAlong with my academic work, I have enjoyed organizing teams to plan both technical and non-technical events. I was a part of the planning committee for the intercollegiate hackathon at our college, called \"inGenius-2019.\" This experience enabled me to put the management and entrepreneurship skills I had learned in a theoretical course into practice. My love for the open- source community and application development sparked my interest in developer student clubs (DSC). Developer Student Clubs are a technical club for college students supported by Google Developers. I led a workshop on building Android applications for first-year students.\n\nAfter I graduate, I want to put the knowledge I've gained into practice by developing ground- breaking software solutions and revolutionizing the ways in which people engage with software applications and machines. To accomplish this goal, I intend to pursue a career as a backend developer/software architect. My ultimate objective is to fully comprehend complex system design concepts like DNS, load balancing, caching, database sharding, and partitioning to achieve application scalability and learn how to improve their efficiency to develop better software systems. In the long term, I intend to become a chief software architect for a technology company.\n\nMy time spent at Illinois Institute of Technology gaining practical experience will serve as a bridge between my past and future while also allowing me to contribute to the software development community. Through independent study and professional experience, I have built a solid foundation in computer science. I sincerely hope the admissions committee will take cognizance of my will to excel in my academic and professional responsibilities and admit me to the university's Master of Science in Computer Science program. I pledge to approach the program with the utmost commitment and to seize the opportunity to benefit the institution and myself.\n"}

I hoped to become a cardiologist; it seemed both challenging and fascinating. However, after I began my pre-med requirements at Metropolis University, curiously, a single class changed the trajectory of my life. The course was titled \u201cThe Science and Business of Cancer Therapies,\u201d and it challenged my beliefs and sense of self in a way no biology or chemistry class ever had. As I delved deep into the study of cancer treatments, pharmaceutical companies, and medical patents, I faced a startling reality: the United States does not offer a singular healthcare system, but rather an array of systems in which certain populations suffer inferior outcomes for reasons as simple as their ZIP Code. Most troubling was the realization that in low-income counties not far from my home, residents face cancer recovery rates 10-20% lower than my own neighbors might.\n\nIssues like these trouble me. Yet, they explain why I changed my major to Community Health with a concentration in Health Planning and Administration, and why I pursued an administrative internship at Kent Hospital in Smallville, KS. They also explain why I am applying to the Master of Health Administration program at Gotham University today. By becoming an administrative leader, I can play a role in improving healthcare access for far more people than I ever could as a doctor.\n\nThe MHA program at the Gotham Luther School of Public Health is my top choice for several reasons, with the yearlong residency chief among them. Far more intense than the simulations or short-terms residencies at other programs, this experience of working full-time in a healthcare setting will prove impactful as I begin my career. It is encouraging to see students from the class of 2022 being placed in residencies in locations as widespread as California, New York, and Florida. Yet, as a Midwesterner, it is also empowering to know that I could work in Kansas if this gave me a greater chance to learn and grow. At the same time, the program\u2019s numerous finance courses interest me deeply. Though I have taken multiple undergraduate courses in healthcare finance and data analysis, I recognize the importance of preparing thoroughly for the complex quantitative aspects of a career in service to large, diverse communities. Encapsulating all of these efforts in an accelerated program will surely be challenging, but this gives me confidence that my Gotham education will make me immediately ready to contribute as a healthcare leader upon graduating.\n\nI also look forward to numerous co-curricular opportunities at Gotham, especially those that will allow me to promote accessibility while learning about large-scale health policy applications. The American Mock World Health Organization seems particularly intriguing. Participating in simulations of the World Health Assembly stands out as an opportunity to consider policy from a macroscopic perspective, and I am excited that Gotham is one of the very few schools who participate. For all these reasons, I feel certain that the Luther MHA program is uniquely poised to offer opportunities I could not find anywhere else.\n\nWhile I believe my academic record, highlighted by my 3.9 major GPA, demonstrates that I will be a strong addition to the MHA program, I think my experience in a hospital setting gives me a unique perspective that other candidates may not have. While interning at Kent Hospital in the summer of 2021, I worked with a wide range of healthcare professionals, including physical therapists, physicians, and hospital administrators. On one particularly impactful project, I was tasked with helping a team interpret three months of patient-survey data and identifying correlations. Which floor the patient stayed on, the problems that occurred most frequently (lack of communication, long discharge process, unprofessional behavior, cleanliness), and the patient\u2019s likelihood of recommending the hospital to family \u2013 these all provided clues to improving patient outcomes and hospital efficiency. I am proud that our findings convinced leadership to address numerous concerns, including revamping their discharge process (the most frequent complaint) and creating a policy requiring physicians and nurses to walk into treatment rooms together to address a perceived lack of communication (another recurring grievance).\n\nAt Kent, I also helped launch a new policy-and-contract software that the hospital is implementing today. Their goal was to make all documents available digitally and I helped by uploading thousands of policies, vendor and physician contracts, and affiliation, sales, and licensing agreements into a new database. Yet, in the end, I feel strongly that my most important experience was shadowing both administrative and operational leaders. I spent hours, and sometimes weeks, with people in nearly every department, from the CEO\u2019s office to patient safety, physician relations, and sterile processing. Observing their interactions made me realize how much collaboration and teamwork goes into making sure a hospital operates smoothly, and I eagerly await the chance to contribute to such teams on a larger scale.\n\nMy career goal is simple: to attain a leadership position in the administrative side of a hospital or healthcare system where I can be of service to communities who, for whatever reason, are not receiving the exceptional care they need. Metropolis, Gotham City, Cincinnati, and Detroit all interest me because 25% or more of their populations live in poverty, almost certainly reflecting unique healthcare needs. I am particularly interested in organizations whose grassroots efforts include opening more free health clinics, hiring more bilingual healthcare workers, hosting educational seminars, and incentivizing physicians and nurses to spend time helping these communities. Thus, organizations such as Stark Health in New Jersey and Shield Health in Illinois are of particular interest to me; the former because of their disease prevention initiatives, and chronic disease-care programs for the uninsured, and the latter for the way they reinvest in community benefit programs for those without the ability to pay. Of course, I realize that I am one person and that the health disparities many communities face are complex beyond reason. Yet, through steady efforts and continued devotion to educating, screening, and treating those who currently face gaps in healthcare access, I am confident that I can build the kind of career that I consider a success.\n\nThe first step to accomplishing this goal is to maximize all the resources available in the Gotham MHA program. During my internship at Kent, every leadership-team member held advanced degrees, typically an MHA, with approximately half also holding an MBA. Through my work with these professionals, I saw firsthand (and learned from anecdotes) how invaluable an advanced Healthcare Administration program can be. The majority of these administrators completed their degrees later in their career, indicating that I will face unique challenges as a recent graduate. Yet, I look forward to surmounting these challenges, knowing it will put me at an advantage professionally and provide me with all the more opportunities to make a difference in my career. Even though the Gotham University MHA program will undoubtedly present a great challenge, I know it will prepare me for a lifelong career in healthcare, and in service to my community.\n"}

I knew the stereotype had arisen from centuries of exotification and exploitation by the West. But this was in stark contrast to my lived experience and that of many young diasporic Asians, raised in immigrant families with little discussion and sometimes outright discouragement of sexuality.\n\nIf two prominent academic concepts are to be believed \u2013 the immigrant paradox in public health, and the model minority theory in sociology \u2013 then one may conclude that Asian Americans are healthier and less prone to risky behavior than typical Americans. Perhaps as a result, Asian Americans are frequently erased in health research, even that which purports to present racial disparities in a particular health area. However, these simplifications have led to neglect of the very real challenges that Asian Americans, particularly women, face in the United States. I hope to challenge these generalizations and study how young second-generation Asian American women navigate sexual health and safety in intimate relationships, given the conflicting messages they may receive from the different cultures with which they grew up. How do these Asian women grapple with being simultaneously hypersexualized and desexualized, and what vulnerabilities does that contradiction generate?\n\nThe PhD program in Community Health at Gotham University would uniquely empower me to explore my research questions, given the university\u2019s exceptional strength in both public health and the study of Asian-American communities. Those in public health often exalt the field\u2019s interdisciplinary nature, and the CH program truly lives up to this by building an outside minor right into the curriculum; with my interests inextricably linked to Asian-American and gender studies, I would embrace the opportunity to formally weave these disciplines into my public-health education through a sociology minor. Similarly, the Wayne School features an array of faculty and research centers specializing in immigration, race, and gender, a telling sign that my own research directions would have ample support.\n\nI am particularly impressed by the work of Dr. Barbara Lee, whose expertise on the confluent impacts of immigration status, ethnic background, and gender on health closely mirrors my own interests. Her leadership of the BOLD research project highlights the healthcare access challenges of vulnerable Asian American young adults, the same underrecognized population I hope to center in my own research. I learned in a conversation with Dr. Lee that she is starting to investigate how immigration status impacts access to sexual and reproductive healthcare through both the BOLD study and a potential upcoming project, and I can tell that working on either of these projects as a graduate researcher would build the precise skills I need to answer my own inquiries. The CH program\u2019s strong grounding in social sciences and social justice, along with Dr. Lee\u2019s mentorship, would provide a foundation for me to fully explore my research interests in a manner unparalleled by other programs I\u2019ve seen.\n\nAt the University of Metropolis, I was fortunate to have access to the unique Health & Society major and Asian-American studies courses, through which I combined the study of health and medicine with a social-sciences perspective in a manner similar to the CH program\u2019s approach. My personal and academic background sparked my passion for studying how social structures and identities are connected to health; subsequently, I\u2019ve sought opportunities to work on meaningful public-health topics and accumulate research experience. I took on the role as a research coordinator at Metropolis Medicine\u2019s Department of Ob/Gyn to immerse myself in the field of sexual/reproductive health \u2013 a topic at the foundation of my research interests, but one I had little interaction with growing up. At the same time, I learned how to execute research projects from quick survey studies to years-long clinical trials. I also gained data-analysis skills through a statistics minor and survey research internships, and qualitative research experience through my student capstone projects and my organization of a study on pregnancy-care experiences for my current position, providing openings for me to utilize either method or even mixed methods in my future research.\n\nMost recently, for my MPH capstone project, I oversaw a focus-group study assessing perceptions of campus intimate partner violence resources. As a former student worker at the Metropolis Violence Prevention center, I was familiar with the range of resources offered by the school, but I learned in conversations that they were often unhelpful or simply not promoted enough, and I sought to transform these conversations into something more tangibly impactful. When the COVID-19 pandemic and campus closures threatened the project\u2019s recruitment efforts, I drew upon my experience to suggest student groups and other campus entities with whom to collaborate. I contributed to not only recruitment but also discussion moderation and qualitative analysis, culminating with a research report and presentation about how remotely-offered student services could convert the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic into an opportunity to increase access. Thus, my extensive research background, adaptability, and passion for advocacy all prepare me well to join the CH PhD program and continue uplifting the voices of community members through research, while further developing my simultaneous interests in ethnic studies, sexual/reproductive health, and gender-based violence.\n\nI envision my future self as a professor at a school of public health or a similar socially-conscious institution, expanding upon my PhD work to teach and conduct research on the social determinants of Asian American and immigrant health. It shouldn\u2019t take a once-in-a-lifetime tragedy and temporary media buzz to spotlight these overlooked groups when my peers and I have been grappling with racism and acculturation for as long as we can remember. I hope that my academic career can validate these stories, and highlight the everyday \u2013 but no less important \u2013 challenges to our well-being that arise from our identities. I would be honored to begin my career in academia at Gotham\u2019s Community Health program, a department just as committed as I am to pushing the disciplinary boundaries of health-equity research and intersectionality.\n"}

In 2020, following a health check on existing infrastructure, I discovered that pipelines were delivering data too slowly to clients. After comparing our runtimes to industry standards, I pitched a project using open-source Apache Airflow to help automate pipelines and centralize patient data into a single workflow. However, when considering how to automate 35% of the data, I learned from the billing team how frequently bills are refinanced in our long-term elderly care programs. Thus, for the first time, I was able to personalize parameters in the pipeline for unaccounted customers. Learning the importance of context for efficient yet equitable automation, I found myself incredibly curious about data-modeling methodologies that can truly represent real-world situations.\n\nThrough Gotham University\u2019s Master\u2019s program in Data Science, I hope to further explore how to enhance representation of data minorities in ML models, and thus ensure inclusive healthcare access for the customers I serve. Earning my MBA at Metropolis University taught me how to coordinate the need for quantitative reasoning and human intuition through A/B testing, and I believe the MSDS program will build on that foundation. Mathematical Foundations in Computer Science, for example, will help me build real-time analytics dashboards that account for insurance claim data-entry errors through discrete probabilistic models. In the same vein, elective offerings such as Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence will enable me to choose predictive models and evaluate their accuracy when applied to large data sets \u2014 particularly useful when predicting whether an insurance claim will necessitate revisions.\n\nResources like the IGNITE competition will also offer opportunities to collaborate on flexible models that solve real-world situations. Having worked on Apache Airflow implementation in WayneHealth, I understand how collaboration can play a key role in implementing a new idea. Having my IGNITE team\u2019s project evaluated by MSDS professors, with their expertise in modular design and user experience, will only help me evaluate my own performance as I translate my education into functional healthcare applications. Thus, I am certain that Gotham\u2019s MSDS program will prepare me to succeed in a team setting that balances many developer roles, while equipping me to better deliver sales pitches to investors.\n\nUpon graduating, I endeavor to apply my education toward applied healthcare projects that focus on providing easy access to preventative care. Transparency is an integral part of healthcare access because it reduces the expenses and time necessary to find patient care. To help facilitate this transparency, I plan to transition into a Senior Data Scientist role in the Emerging Technologies Collaborative (ETC) at WayneHealth, hopefully working on projects that implement data-driven recommendations for our automated batch processes and servers. When storing vast amounts of patient data across different platforms, vulnerability patches and triage alerts often lead to reactive outcomes that can create downtime for end users. As a result, I seek to implement agentless server monitoring to, first, predict unscheduled outages for our billing and medical coverage systems, and second, recognize patterns in server behavior. Helping recognize outage patterns will not only help me identify problems beforehand, but also decipher the causes of live servers crashing. However, projects outside of WayneHealth excite me as well, including Amgen\u2019s Crystal Bone algorithm which uses AI and machine-learning models to detect bones at risk for osteoporotic fractures. This project was the first tool I have ever seen that uses diagnostic codes sourced from WayneHealth electronic health records, and it inspired me to create my own model using EHR data. In the future, I hope to use EHR diagnostic codes to predict the cost of treatment for those prone to risk, as indicated by the algorithm.\n\nNot only has my position as a software engineer equipped me with strong technical skills, but it has also given me the discipline to continuously learn what I do not yet know. On a project named Karra, an optical-character recognition engine which scans personal information from faxed hospital claim forms, I learned how to develop my own algorithms to calculate the coordinates of form fields to parse data. The technical skills I have gained, in tandem with the unwavering tenacity I developed in this position, will allow me to face any challenge that arises during the MSDS program.\n\nTo further prepare for the rigors of the MSDS program, I completed University of Pennsylvania Engineering MOOCs on Coursera, including the Introduction to Python and Java specialization taught by Brandon Krakowsky and the course Computational Thinking for Problem Solving by Susan Davidson. These MOOCs helped me comprehend important programming paradigms such as unit testing and debugging, which will help me test edge cases in MSDS course projects. Also, MOOCs from UC San Diego, such as Python for Data Science and Probability and Statistics in Data Science Using Python, enabled me to optimize data-cleansing techniques for better runtimes. The MCDS program\u2019s Big Data Analytics course will culminate this self-learning effort, providing a solid theoretical understanding of the tools and techniques used to extract insights from large datasets.\n\nWhile I have taken on a breadth of challenging problems in computer science and implemented solutions at WayneHealth, my prior undergraduate performance did not always reflect my best ability. Between Spring 2016 and Spring 2017, I experienced a personal health challenge that required substantial time away from the UC Coast City campus. I was further distracted by the realities of personally financing my education \u2013 working full-time for the National Security Agency (NSA) \u2013 while also suffering the loss of a close family member. Even as I struggled I knew the importance of higher education, and, advocating for my own success, I persisted. To strengthen my educational background, I enrolled in online courses and built coping mechanisms, such as managing my time between online courses and on-campus courses efficiently. In the end, these efforts helped me graduate early in the fall of 2018, and I plan to apply the same level of resilience throughout the rest of my academic and professional career.\n\nAs I grow increasingly aware of the intersection between ML and social computing, I am determined to study learning techniques such as principal component analysis, and to perform research in data organization/completeness. With my strong self-guided background in applied computer science, and my professional experience with ML and software development in the healthcare insurance industry, the practical knowledge I build at Gotham will help me make voices heard in the data we interact with in our daily lives."}

To put it more simply: can we make a winning decision from a set of an infinitely-large number of future scenarios? Certainly, I could extend this question to other games and real-life scenarios. Unfortunately, computing all probable states and representing the states as a graph is a time-consuming and expensive exercise. Stochastically optimizing these large graphs and churning out meaningful insights would require unorthodox approaches in optimization and Machine Learning. Yet, these difficulties represent exactly why I believe the MS in OR at Columbia University will provide the ideal environment to continue my education.\n\nWorking as a Machine Learning Engineer at Stark AI helped me understand how mathematically expensive it is to compute and optimize a Neural Network graph. Later, at Wayne Enterprises, I had the opportunity to manage and architect a Blockchain system, and was able to show how the consensus mechanism could be used to enable supply-chain transparency. Working for both of these startups helped me understand these challenges on an intricate level, while developing and maintaining large projects. After graduating from Eastern Univ. Engineering, I joined X-Consulting as an Application Development Associate, typically helping Japanese clients transform their business needs into technical specifications. Within days of joining X-Consulting, I took up voluntary leadership roles and delegated work to other Associates. Today, I am a part of a high performing agile team responsible for architecting and integrating SAP-ABAP analytics modules in large-scale SAP-ERP systems and data warehouses. Working for X-Consulting helped me understand the need for organizational hierarchy and the importance of data-driven decisions in an era that generates petabytes of information every second.\n\nAt Columbia University, I aim to improve my operational and technical skills, particularly in discrete optimization. Distinguished professors in Columbia\u2019s Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research\u2019s \u2013 Professor Charles Xavier and Professor Bruce Banner \u2013 have already been influential in my education. Their work on the Economics of Permissioned Blockchain Adoption allowed me to introspect the viable strategies required to adopt a permissioned blockchain network. Their thesis concludes by stating the strategies for adopting a blockchain so that the adoption is in equilibrium with the cost. In graduate school, I hope to study systems alternate to the blockchain that are inexpensive and can scale with ease. I believe without a doubt that by working with faculty such as Dr. Xavier and Dr. Banner, I can find an economically viable strategy that is as effective as a blockchain network, without compromising the consensus mechanism.\n\nI plan to choose the Optimization concentration and include Computational Discrete Optimization in my coursework. After completing my master\u2019s degree, I hope to work as an Analyst/SDE (Machine-Learning) for an organization like Google, Goldman Sachs, or Amazon. In the long term, I intend to become a Chief Technology Officer of a technology company. Thus, the department\u2019s high job placement statistics (93%) are a major reason for my motivation to apply to Columbia University. I believe that my varied work experience and the coursework I have completed  in the past few years have all prepared me to pursue an MS degree in OR. I am able to pick up abstract concepts and new mathematics quickly. For these reasons, I am confident that I would excel in the program, and that upon completion of my graduate degree, I will be able to solve optimization problems (np-hard/np-complete), architect robust Machine-Learning models, and make critical decisions driven by data. To be offered admission to Columbia University would not only be a tremendous honor, but also confirm my hard work in the past, and my commitment to work even harder in the future.\n"}

Ninety-six poles emitted light and sound, and visitors touch-activated symphonic waves, gasping at the semblant magic of it all. Exhausted from weeks of design, fabrication, and installation with my team, I observed these crowds with their frenzy of languages but matching reactions of wonder. Though it was my job, I could not help asking: Why does this union of design and technology work so seamlessly to evoke seemingly universal happiness? Or, working backward, how do differences in our abilities, experiences, identity, or culture change the way we interact with the world?\n\nThe potential of design and psychology to create productive commonality \u2014 this is why I want to study in the Masters of Human-Computer Interaction program at Gotham University. As a trained architect, I see great potential in the field of HCI to shrink the scale of my previous work in public spaces in Gotham, New York, Miami, and Sydney \u2014 to make it more user-focused while expanding it to be more human-centric. The MHCI program will provide me with the resources to accomplish this, approaching both physical and digital design challenges that integrate psychological components unapproachable through architecture.\n\nThe curriculum\u2019s emphasis on technical skills is particularly important to me; it will build my capacity to translate ideas into workable prototypes. Special Topics courses will teach me how to conduct user research and identify opportunities where machine learning can add value. AI Product and Service Design, taught by Professor Lucius Fox, perfectly embodies this approach. It asks how designers can meet users\u2019 needs, while building purposefully inclusive AI that does not betray users\u2019 trust or ethics. Furthermore, Dr. Selina Kyle\u2019s work in accessibility demonstrates how systems can be leveraged to equalize opportunities for marginalized populations; as my own father is partially blind and deaf, this topic is especially important to me. I would be eager to work with Dr. Kyle on research that explores assistive technology, and thus develop skills in ergonomic design for dynamically adaptive devices.\n\nFurthermore, the MHCI capstone will be a paramount opportunity for me to collaborate in applying human-centric values across the product development lifecycle. I hope to work with a sponsor such as Daggett Digital or Riddle Labs, exploring HCI applications that I have not yet approached in my architectural and design career. Hopefully, this experience will prepare me to work, post-graduation, at firms such as Turtle Design or YEO, the latter of whose Dusk platform exemplifies the type of digital/physical solutions I hope to build in my career.\n\nStudying architecture at Metropolis University proved valuable in learning problem-solving through design-thinking. I studied how physical space can shape opportunities for user interactions, and through intensive studios, learned to design at different scales. In one particular course of note, Design Operations and Tactics with Professor Barbara Gordon, I explored how embedded technologies provide a framework for improvisation between people and the urban environment. Utilizing architecture as a technological interface, and analyzing concepts such as ubiquitous computing and calm technology, I obtained my first introduction to the world of HCI. Furthermore, in my senior year research developing large-scale 3D printing technologies for construction, my partner and I incorporated a diversity of uses into our building design. Under the advisory of Prof. Viktor Fries, we were selected to present at a TEDxMetro U event, where we engaged with academic and industry professionals who offered critical feedback, strengthening the project and demonstrating the value of cross-disciplinary collaboration.\n\nAs a designer at WayneLab, I have traveled to four continents to build unique large-scale interactive pieces that shape experiences through technology, color, space, and materiality. When designing for a project, I am cognizant of the various user groups along the lifespan of the project: the fabrication specialists, the construction team, and the audience. Using Rhino 3D, I developed a frame-support system for computationally-derived hanging art pieces that has been adapted for suspended sculptures in Sydney, Philadelphia, and Boston. I was the installation project manager in Australia, where I oversaw international transportation, facilitated installation logistics, and managed construction. Aware that every stage of a project is essential for optimizing user experience, my studies in the MHCI program will maintain a conscientious intention when investigating both big-picture ideas and smaller mechanical processes.\n\nMuch like the glinting lights of my installation on that Gotham City pier, technology and design offer the opportunity for interactions and connections beyond language barriers, geographical limitations, (dis)capacities, and identity politics. Now, by studying user research methods, cognitive processes, and human-centric design approaches in the MHCI program at Gotham, I will seek to evolve as a product designer who can diversify designs to be more accessible, user-friendly, and adaptable for all people.\n"}

According to Nature, the average drug costs $2.6 billion to develop, yet DSP-1181 was developed five times faster than usual using Exscientia\u2019s AI tool, significantly reducing its development cost. Innovations like these fascinate me. Along with drug discovery, AI will soon lead to breakthroughs in disease research and diagnosis, personalized treatment, clinical trial research, radiology, and more. I believe that my background in Bioengineering, combined with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence in the Stark University MS/PhD Program, will allow me to contribute to these breakthroughs in a meaningful way, making healthcare affordable and improving patient outcomes.\n\nAt Gotham University, I majored in Bioengineering with a specialization in Computer Science, providing me with a strong foundation in Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, C++, Python, Matlab, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Computer Networks. In my capstone project, I created a congenital clubfoot compliance sensor which collected data to aid Dr. Otto Octavius and his peers in their disease research. This project finished in first place within the department-wide symposium. Furthermore, since graduating, I have continued expanding my CS competencies by taking additional coursework in NLP with Python & Data Structures and Algorithms through Stanford Continuing Studies and UC Berkeley Extension school respectively. In one of these classes, I led the development of a Random Forest anti-microbial peptide identification application based on frog-skin-secretion data. With these experiences, I believe my foundation in CS is robust enough to tackle the greater challenges of graduate study at Stark University.\n\nAdditionally, I have a breadth of lab experience ranging from Narcolepsy and Retinal Prosthesis labs at Stanford to catalytic enzyme-mimic research at Professor Erik Selvig\u2019s Lab at the University of Sydney. As mentioned previously, I also spent a semester at Empire University as a Research Assistant in Dr. Bruce Banner\u2019s laboratory, where I learned to apply Marinus to the evolution of a catalytic enzyme, a de novo beta barrel.\n\nToday, at ShieldCodex, a protein engineering company, I conduct research to evolve enzyme therapies for various diseases through High Throughput Screening. During the development of a specific gene therapy, we found that we lacked the equipment to detect certain Post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the wet lab. I took the initiative to address this issue and I created a proprietary N-linked glycosylation detection and Tyrosine sulfation and Thrombin cut site prediction application. My Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) application was the first PTM detection tool at my company, and it had a higher accuracy (Matthews correlation coefficient) on the dataset than any other state-of-the-art application in this problem area. This application led to the development of a gene that was certifiably safer before insertion into the human body, and the application is now being deployed in the company-wide software package for projects beyond its original scope.\n\nMy experiences have shown me that there is much work to be done to integrate AI and Biology. During development of my PTM tool, I saw that the industry standard NLP-based approach to Tyrosine Sulfation detection has limited capacity to capture protein structure data. Additionally, Tyrosine Sulfation data was scarce. Similarly, in my capstone project at Gotham University, I found that a shortage of data had stunted congenital clubfoot research. To capture the nuances of biological data and address biological data scarcity, we require AI experts to create tailored algorithms and tools, rather than out-of-the-box solutions.\n\nThus, my research and work experiences have shown me that the overlap between Biology and Computer Science is ripe for exploration, and Stark University\u2019s MS/PhD Computer Science Program seems perfectly suited to pursuing this goal. Specializing in Artificial Intelligence will allow me to formalize and further build ML expertise. I am excited by the prospect of coursework like CS311A: Machine Learning: From Gene Editing to Protein Optimization, which seems tailor-made for my interest in protein research. At the same time, I look forward to strengthening my knowledge of combinatorial algorithms, statistical theory, and probabilistic graphical models, which are all essential in building cutting edge AI products given the probabilistic nature and complexity of biological data. I am keen to explore the possibility of conducting protein modeling, folding, and optimization research with Professor Jane Foster\u2019s group and the SAIR Lab. Her research to identify drug candidates with proxy regression models instead of physics simulations (such as Marinus) deeply interests me. The opportunity to work with Professor Foster, other CS faculty, and my peers will be a valuable asset in my academic development.\n\nWe are only beginning to understand the impact of AI on healthcare. The inevitable integration of these fields will require scientists with thorough expertise in both. My extensive work at the intersection of healthcare and ML has equipped me with the skills needed to help bridge the gap between them. I am confident that an education at Stark will allow me to grow as a data scientist, and help make healthcare more affordable and accessible, thus improving patient outcomes in the future.\n"}

It reminded me of high school in China, when for various reasons I performed poorly in class, and teachers labeled me a \u201ctroubled student.\u201d I knew this was not true; there were real human reasons for my struggles at the time, particularly my transition from international schooling in the US to the rigid classrooms of my home country. Many years passed before I successfully eliminated this label from my consciousness, eventually graduating from UC-Coastal City, and subsequently becoming a straight-A non-degree student in the Gotham Psychology Department this year.\n\nToday, I am deeply fascinated by how people navigate inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes by adjusting one to fit the other, and am almost intimidated by the potential of this process if engineered with direction. The same phenomenon used to praise people and lead them to success can also convince others to consolidate poor performance as part of their self-identity. The prevalence of ability-grouping in Chinese high schools often leads to discouraging feedback for lower-ranking students, creating the false belief that they are \u201ctroubled.\u201d I believe this public-ranking system is deeply flawed, that I myself was an \u201cexception to the rule,\u201d and that many low-ranking students lose motivation to pursue their academic potential.\n\nMy curiosity regarding the potential for cognitive dissonance to be engineered in academic interventions has shaped my goal of pursuing an Ed.M. in Education and Human Development at Gotham University. I hope to contribute to the Chinese education system by researching cognitive frameworks that promote positive thoughts, beliefs, and actions, and ultimately help \u201ctroubled students\u201d break free from self-limiting labels. By studying developmental and educational psychology, motivation, and cognitive dissonance at GGSE, I aim to prepare for future doctoral research in adolescent development, and its context in maladaptive classroom settings, and ultimately engineer interventions that allow students to systematically shift their thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors in positive directions.\n\nI am fortunate to have already begun this journey as a GSAS non-degree student throughout the past year. Currently, in Professor Dick Grayson\u2019s graduate course on developmental psychology, I am studying fundamental concepts in early-childhood development, and have elevated my critical thinking skills, especially in lectures where Professor Grayson challenges classic experiments. Furthermore, I am excited to soon study motivation in educational settings from Professor Edward Nygma in his J-term educational psychology course. Grounding myself in the theoretical and empirical literature of classroom motivation will be a crucial preparation for developing my own research questions as an aspiring graduate student.\n\nAfter officially beginning the Ed.M. program, courses like Innovation Design: Educational Technology, led by Professor Viktor Fries, will help me cultivate interventions that move from theory into technologically driven application. With modest experience in technical development, I look forward to prototyping and testing interventions that allow students to resolve cognitive dissonance by systematically shifting their attitudes and behaviors towards a positive direction \u2014 or, to be bold, intentionally introducing cognitive dissonance with a strong force of appraisal that leans towards desired positive outcomes. Considering my own unique (and self-driven) educational experiences, I am deeply attracted to the learning philosophy of trial and error, and believe such courses will be an integral step toward achieving my goals.\n\nI also cherish GGSE\u2019s option to cross-register. I hope to take seminars with Professor Selina Kyle from the Gotham School of Business, as her research into the dysfunctional consequences of disconfirming high-performance expectations aligns perfectly with my goals in China. If students struggle academically due to cognitive dissonance from unmet expectations, can interpretation of these expectations change through intervention or appraisal? Dr. Kyle\u2019s work, as described in Rebel Genius, provides a unique foundation for my quest to develop intellectual tools that shift resolution of cognitive dissonance in a positive way. By translating her work from organizational to classroom settings, I hope to study how \u201ctroubled students\u201d can reframe into radiant \u201crebels\u201d who change the world for the better through their unconventional outlooks.\n\nMy preparation for these goals began with my undergraduate Economics studies at UC-Coastal City, which provided a solid quantitative background and a lens to view problems through behavioral-economics models. After graduating, I took both undergraduate- and graduate-level psychology courses at Metropolis University and Gotham respectively, acquiring fundamental knowledge of general, personality, social, cognitive, and developmental psychology. Elective courses further equipped me with strong skills in psychology-oriented programming using Python, PsychoPy, R, and Stata.\n\nAs my cross-cultural research will aid in the translation of knowledge, skillsets, and interventions from GGSE to high schools in China, I have recently begun working with GGSE PhD Jiaqi Zhang as co-author of a study on how Chinese Immigrant and European-American parents and children use questions during free play. We are investigating questioning styles from a descriptive, cross-cultural, and intra-cultural perspective. I am currently responsible for categorizing and coding parents\u2019 and children\u2019s questions from videos of interactions through the software Datavyu, and creating the literature review. I look forward to taking on more responsibility and writing the paper with the goal of publishing in 2022/23.\n\nI have also worked as a Research Assistant in Dr. Jonathan Crane\u2019s laboratory since spring 2020. During this time, Professor Crane has inspired me to question where knowledge comes from, and ignited my desire to produce new knowledge. Working closely with his PhD student Barbara Gordon has enhanced my practical communication skills, as well as my technical skills in analyzing data through Python and R, and designing and translating surveys through online platforms.\n\nFurthermore, after graduating college, I worked in the lab of Professor Haixian Li at Tsinghua University during the Spring 2021 semester. There, via Zoom, I delivered bi-monthly (and bilingual) lectures in Social Psychology for international students in the psychology graduate program. I believe this atypical teaching experience \u2014 combining a humor-based teaching style with the professionalism of my own favorite professors at Coastal City, Metropolis, and Gotham \u2014 will be a benefit as I begin the Ed.M. program.\n\nNow, having broken free from the \u201ctroubled student\u201d label and discovered my own academic passion, I am determined to develop intellectual tools to help similar students in Chinese high schools through methodologies based on cognitive dissonance. I aim to accomplish this goal through intensive study of developmental psychology and motivation, and hopefully by working closely with professors Edward Nygma, Selina Kyle, and Viktor Fries. My broad academic and research background in economics and psychology ensure my compatibility with the Human Development and Education program, and I believe that pursuing an Ed.M. at Gotham will fully prepare me to effect real change for students in China and beyond.\n"}

In 2020, following a health check on existing infrastructure, I discovered that pipelines were delivering data too slowly to clients. After comparing our runtimes to industry standards, I pitched a project using open-source Apache Airflow to help automate pipelines and centralize patient data into a single workflow. However, when considering how to automate 35% of the data, I learned from the billing team how frequently bills are refinanced in our long-term elderly care programs. Thus, for the first time, I was able to personalize parameters in the pipeline for unaccounted customers. Learning the importance of context for efficient yet equitable automation, I found myself incredibly curious about data-modeling methodologies that can truly represent real-world situations.\n\nThrough Gotham University\u2019s Master\u2019s program in Data Science, I hope to further explore how to enhance representation of data minorities in ML models, and thus ensure inclusive healthcare access for the customers I serve. Earning my MBA at Metropolis University taught me how to coordinate the need for quantitative reasoning and human intuition through A/B testing, and I believe the MSDS program will build on that foundation. Mathematical Foundations in Computer Science, for example, will help me build real-time analytics dashboards that account for insurance claim data-entry errors through discrete probabilistic models. In the same vein, elective offerings such as Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence will enable me to choose predictive models and evaluate their accuracy when applied to large data sets \u2014 particularly useful when predicting whether an insurance claim will necessitate revisions.\n\nResources like the IGNITE competition will also offer opportunities to collaborate on flexible models that solve real-world situations. Having worked on Apache Airflow implementation in WayneHealth, I understand how collaboration can play a key role in implementing a new idea. Having my IGNITE team\u2019s project evaluated by MSDS professors, with their expertise in modular design and user experience, will only help me evaluate my own performance as I translate my education into functional healthcare applications. Thus, I am certain that Gotham\u2019s MSDS program will prepare me to succeed in a team setting that balances many developer roles, while equipping me to better deliver sales pitches to investors.\n\nUpon graduating, I endeavor to apply my education toward applied healthcare projects that focus on providing easy access to preventative care. Transparency is an integral part of healthcare access because it reduces the expenses and time necessary to find patient care. To help facilitate this transparency, I plan to transition into a Senior Data Scientist role in the Emerging Technologies Collaborative (ETC) at WayneHealth, hopefully working on projects that implement data-driven recommendations for our automated batch processes and servers. When storing vast amounts of patient data across different platforms, vulnerability patches and triage alerts often lead to reactive outcomes that can create downtime for end users. As a result, I seek to implement agentless server monitoring to, first, predict unscheduled outages for our billing and medical coverage systems, and second, recognize patterns in server behavior. Helping recognize outage patterns will not only help me identify problems beforehand, but also decipher the causes of live servers crashing. However, projects outside of WayneHealth excite me as well, including Amgen\u2019s Crystal Bone algorithm which uses AI and machine-learning models to detect bones at risk for osteoporotic fractures. This project was the first tool I have ever seen that uses diagnostic codes sourced from WayneHealth electronic health records, and it inspired me to create my own model using EHR data. In the future, I hope to use EHR diagnostic codes to predict the cost of treatment for those prone to risk, as indicated by the algorithm.\n\nNot only has my position as a software engineer equipped me with strong technical skills, but it has also given me the discipline to continuously learn what I do not yet know. On a project named Karra, an optical-character recognition engine which scans personal information from faxed hospital claim forms, I learned how to develop my own algorithms to calculate the coordinates of form fields to parse data. The technical skills I have gained, in tandem with the unwavering tenacity I developed in this position, will allow me to face any challenge that arises during the MSDS program.\n\nTo further prepare for the rigors of the MSDS program, I completed University of Pennsylvania Engineering MOOCs on Coursera, including the Introduction to Python and Java specialization taught by Brandon Krakowsky and the course Computational Thinking for Problem Solving by Susan Davidson. These MOOCs helped me comprehend important programming paradigms such as unit testing and debugging, which will help me test edge cases in MSDS course projects. Also, MOOCs from UC San Diego, such as Python for Data Science and Probability and Statistics in Data Science Using Python, enabled me to optimize data-cleansing techniques for better runtimes. The MCDS program\u2019s Big Data Analytics course will culminate this self-learning effort, providing a solid theoretical understanding of the tools and techniques used to extract insights from large datasets.\n\nWhile I have taken on a breadth of challenging problems in computer science and implemented solutions at WayneHealth, my prior undergraduate performance did not always reflect my best ability. Between Spring 2016 and Spring 2017, I experienced a personal health challenge that required substantial time away from the UC Coast City campus. I was further distracted by the realities of personally financing my education \u2013 working full-time for the National Security Agency (NSA) \u2013 while also suffering the loss of a close family member. Even as I struggled I knew the importance of higher education, and, advocating for my own success, I persisted. To strengthen my educational background, I enrolled in online courses and built coping mechanisms, such as managing my time between online courses and on-campus courses efficiently. In the end, these efforts helped me graduate early in the fall of 2018, and I plan to apply the same level of resilience throughout the rest of my academic and professional career.\n\nAs I grow increasingly aware of the intersection between ML and social computing, I am determined to study learning techniques such as principal component analysis, and to perform research in data organization/completeness. With my strong self-guided background in applied computer science, and my professional experience with ML and software development in the healthcare insurance industry, the practical knowledge I build at Gotham will help me make voices heard in the data we interact with in our daily lives.\n"}

At that point, I was already intrigued by AR\u2019s possibilities in diverse fields, from entertainment to aiding surgeons. Then, after two weeks of writing C# in Unity and establishing a workflow from Autodesk Revit, I loaded the prototype onto my phone and ecstatically invited my colleagues to try. Immediately, however, as I watched them rotate the virtual 3D structure by swiping on a 2D screen, I understood (with dismay) how counterintuitive the interaction was. At the time, I realized that products like daily-wear AR glasses could make architectural visualization more intuitive, but due to challenges with optics, batteries, and spatial understanding, these do not yet exist. Now, I wonder if solving these problems will be enough for widespread adoption at all. To what extent are we clinging to formats that do not present an effective way to interact with virtual content?\n\nWhich type of interface most complements AR? Which most improves cognitive processing and decision-making? Brain-Computer Interfaces are the common answer, but if so, what is the best approach to combining AR and BCI? What kind of neural activity should be employed? How can we design AR experiences for reactive BCIs? These questions lingered in my mind in the months that followed my internship. They remained there well after earning my degree in Computer Science, and even today, they resonate with the very same frequency. This is precisely why I seek admission to the Master\u2019s Program in Computer Science at Stark University: to ascertain the optimal approach for virtual interactions that reduce cognitive load, enrich the senses, and augment human capabilities.\n\nPerhaps no other graduate program in the world is more uniquely suited to helping me explore this niche within Human-Computer Interaction. The variety of interdisciplinary research carried out at the Stark HCI Lab, and the fact that it is one of the few funded master\u2019s program that allow specialization in HCI, all compel my decision to apply. Certainly, coursework such as MCS731 Constructing Cross Reality Applications and MCS728 Affective Computing will prove essential as I begin to comprehend the core principles and design guidelines required for a thesis studying responsive and instinctual interactivity. Most importantly, however, is the opportunity to conduct research under Dr. Bruce Banner, Dr. Erik Selvig, and Dr. Jane Foster, whose work aligns perfectly with my goals of enhancing human cognition.\n\nParticularly intriguing is Dr. Banner\u2019s study on Electrodermal Activity and its relationship to physiological arousal. I hope to explore how this can be implemented as a metric to uncover cognitive loads of atypical input modalities. I am also captivated by Dr. Selvig\u2019s work in augmenting user perception of the environment, and hope to investigate how eye-tracking can strengthen the system\u2019s perception of user intent in HearThere, and how the sensor network in Tesseract can be used for augmented on-site exploration through persistent anchors. Additionally, I am open to working under Dr. Foster as her projects on musical expression and therapy (Vocal Waves) are similar to my ongoing work, Fluid Fingers. Having worked on numerous similar projects, I am confident I can make substantial contributions to these and other projects at Stark, while simultaneously exploring esoteric approaches like functional near-infrared spectroscopy for its superior spatial resolution (as compared to EEG) and resistance towards motion artifacts.\n\nPerfect as the opportunity may seem, I am well aware that the daunting problems of AR require far more than general competence. Fortunately, my academic and research experiences have equipped me with the tools to face them. I was introduced to immersive technology in undergraduate coursework at Empire State University, such as Computer Graphics and Virtual and Augmented Reality. The Interaction Design Specialization from UC San Diego (via Coursera) further improved my understanding of Ideation, Prototyping, and Evaluation methods. Additionally, during my final undergraduate year, I developed a framework, ILMR, that allowed for prototyping hand interactions through direct manipulation with virtual content. Inspired by Google Cardboard, I conceived it using inexpensive and accessible modules like the Zeiss OnePlus headset and the Leap Motion Controller. However, it lacked depth perception and haptic feedback, which are vital in letting the user know they have successfully interacted with virtual content. Through a collaboration with Dr. Otto Octavius, a postdoctoral researcher at the Osborn Private Science Institute, we developed an interface, OptiTouch, that provided the semblance of haptic feedback using only visual cues.\n\nMy most rewarding experience, however, was not with ILMR, but rather the research I conducted unofficially with Professor Charles Xavier after graduation. I was intrigued by Neurofeedback and its non-pharmacological approach towards mental health therapy, but felt the feedback modality lacked appeal. Keeping ADHD-diagnosed children in mind, we devised an AR telekinetic experience where a user could bend a virtual spoon by reaching the desired psychological state. This work was accepted to the International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, where AR academia veteran Dr. Reed Richards claimed it to be impressive.\n\nIn my free time, I actively participate in hackathons, where I have led teams to multiple triumphs and developed multiple AR apps. One such was a music visualizer, VizAR, now published on the App Store. I redesigned the particle system in VizAR for Head-Mounted Displays, and enabled hand-particle interactions by implementing a Signed Distance Field. This ultimately led to my work, Fluid Fingers, which aims to elicit emotional states akin to those exhibited in live music performances. Considering these experiences, I feel confident that I am prepared to hone my abilities even further at the Stark Lab.\n\nDuring my architectural design internship two years ago, I saw immediately the great chasm between our current technological capabilities with AR, and normal users\u2019 ability to employ them. The questions that arose have been my guiding force ever since. This is precisely why I seek to contribute to the field of Human-Computer Interaction, and eventually work as a researcher in industry, ensuring AR\u2019s impact in people\u2019s everyday lives. To begin this effort in the Stark MS CS program would be the most tremendous honor of my career.\n"}
